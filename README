h1. Bugs


Quality can not be scripted for web export currently. Instead the quality will
be set to whatever the quality was last set to in Acorn. Open Web Export in
Acorn through File -> Web Export to change your quality settings. The creator
of Acorn is aware of this and has notified me it will be fixed in Acorn 3.0.1.
